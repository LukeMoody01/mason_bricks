# Contributing to a brick

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ§±ðŸš€

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment,
and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to change the public API, or make any non-trivial changes
to the implementation, we recommend filing an issue.
This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant
effort into it.

If youâ€™re only fixing a bug, itâ€™s fine to submit a pull request right away
but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what youâ€™re fixing.
This is helpful in case we donâ€™t accept that specific fix but want to keep
track of the issue.

## Creating a Pull Request

Before creating a pull request please:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
1. Install all dependencies (`flutter packages get` or `pub get`).
1. Squash your commits and ensure you have a meaningful commit message.
1. If you've changed the public API, make sure to update/add documentation.
1. Create the Pull Request.
1. Verify that all status checks are passing.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your
pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional
design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately
accepted.

## Adding an example

Examples live in the `examples` folder.

- For a new brick example, add it to the `brickname` folder in `examples`.
- Any changes you make to a brick will have to be updated in the example folder.
